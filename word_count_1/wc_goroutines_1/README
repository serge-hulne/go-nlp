A modified version of wordcount.go with goroutines by Vladimir Sibirov (from the gloang-nuts post entitled: "Lazy parallelism benchmark ").

The modification is as follows:

- The two channels are declared as global variables (so there is no need to pass them to the goroutines).
- The string passed to the line-processing goroutine is passed by address (to avoid unnecessary copies).
